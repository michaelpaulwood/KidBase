# Instructions:
# 1. Create a new Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
# 2. Enable Authentication and choose Sign-in providers (Email/Password and Google)
# 3. Create a Firestore database
# 4. Copy this file to .env.local and replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase config
# 5. Make sure .env.local is added to .gitignore (it should be by default)

# Security Notes:
# - These are public environment variables (prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_)
# - They will be visible in the browser, which is normal for Firebase client apps
# - Firebase security is handled by Firestore security rules and Authentication, not by hiding these values
