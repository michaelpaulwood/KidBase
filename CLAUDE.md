## Key Implementation Details

### Authentication
- Firebase Auth with email/password
- Global auth state via React Context (`useAuth` hook)
- Protected routes with automatic redirects
- User data stored in Firestore on registration

### Modern 3D Design System
- Kid-friendly color palette: Purple (primary), Green (success), Pink, Orange, Cyan
- "Brutal" shadow system with 3D depth effects (shadow-brutal, shadow-brutal-lg)
- Clean typography: Inter for headers, DM Sans for body text
- Enhanced button interactions with hover/active states and translations
- Professional design system showcase page at /elements
- Component variants system with 3D visual effects

### Core Pages
1. **Landing (/)**: Gaming-style hero with "KidBase vs. months wasted" + 3D feature cards (no navigation)
2. **Auth (/auth)**: Login/signup forms with validation and 3D styling
3. **Dashboard (/dashboard)**: Protected user area with profile/stats
4. **Elements (/elements)**: Professional design system showcase (no navigation)

### Development Philosophy
- Mobile-first responsive design
- TypeScript strict mode
- Component reusability
- Zero Next.js template bloat
- Production-ready error handling

## Current Status: v3.9 Onboarding System Complete âœ…

**Complete**: Basic Onboarding Flow with Auth Context Refresh

### Onboarding System Implementation

**Core Concept**: Two-layered authentication system foundation
- **Outer Layer**: Firebase Auth (family-level security) âœ…
- **Inner Layer**: PIN system (family member access control) ðŸ“‹ *Ready for Phase 2*

**Phase 1 Completed**: Basic onboarding flow with completion tracking
1. âœ… Onboarding page creation with 3D design system
2. âœ… Database completion tracking with `completeFamilyOnboarding()`
3. âœ… Routing guards for onboarding status
4. âœ… Auth context refresh system for real-time updates
5. âœ… Complete redirect flow working properly

**Working Routing Logic**:
```
Firebase Auth Success â†’ Check onboardingComplete
â”œâ”€â”€ false â†’ Redirect to /onboarding
â””â”€â”€ true â†’ Redirect to /dashboard

/onboarding â†’ Complete Setup Button
â””â”€â”€ Update DB â†’ Refresh Auth Context â†’ Redirect to /dashboard
```

**Files Created**:
- âœ… `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` - Beautiful onboarding completion page
- âœ… `lib/db.ts` - Enhanced with `completeFamilyOnboarding()` function

**Files Enhanced**:
- âœ… `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added onboarding status guards
- âœ… `hooks/useAuth.tsx` - Added `refreshUser()` function for auth context refresh
- âœ… `types/user.ts` - Added `refreshUser` to AuthContextType interface
- âœ… `src/app/(auth)/auth/page.tsx` - Updated redirect logic for onboarding

**Key Technical Achievement**:
Fixed auth context refresh issue where database updates weren't reflected in React state, eliminating redirect loops.
